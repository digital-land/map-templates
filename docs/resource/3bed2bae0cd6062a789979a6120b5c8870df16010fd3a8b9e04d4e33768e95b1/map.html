Camden Council and the Mayor will seek to ensure that a new or refurbished Euston station is of the highest architectural quality to create a world class station, public transport interchange and integrated public realm and above station development which facilitates new (where practicable at ground level) east-west and north-south routes through the site and will seek lowered tracks and platforms as part of redevelopment as a preference. There is potential for between 1,000 and approximately 1,900 new homes and between 7,200 and approximately 13,600 additional jobs, along with 1,400 replacement jobs to be provided here depending on the station design and redevelopment footprint, constraints associated with railway infrastructure, particularly the cost and viability of decking, and compatibility with the plan objectives and policies. A significant proportion, at least 30% (see Strategic Principle EAP 1), of any new office and/or research and development space should accommodate knowledge based, science based, innovative and creative industries to capitalise on the potential to create a knowledge and medical hub around Euston.","resource":"3bed2bae0cd6062a789979a6120b5c8870df16010fd3a8b9e04d4e33768e95b1","point":[51.529231,-0.135005],"size":10.6},{"entry-date":"2019-12-01","organisation":"local-authority-eng:CMD","site":"LBCBLR077","site-address":"Farringdon Point 29-35 Farringdon Road London EC1M 3JF","site-plan-url":"https://opendata.camden.gov.uk/Environment/Brownfield-Land-Register-Map/g8xk-ktap","deliverable":"yes","ownership":"","planning-permission-status":"permissioned","planning-permission-type":"full planning permission","hazardous-substances":"","latitude":"51.519934","longitude":"-0.106275","hectares":"0.03","minimum-net-dwellings":"5","maximum-net-dwellings":"5","start-date":"2017-12-22","end-date":"","notes":".
